t distribution, χ2 distribution, F distribution



----- t distribution

t = (x̄ – μ) / (s/√n)

Where,

x̄ is the sample mean
μ is the population mean
s is the standard deviation
n is the size of the given sample



-----  χ2 distribution
If a random variable Z has the standard normal distribution, then Z^2 has the χ2 distribution with 1 degree of freedom.
If Z1,Z2,...,Zk are independent standard normal distribution random variables, then 
Z1^2 + Z2^2 + ... + Zk^2 has a χ2 distribution with k degrees of freedom.

the mean of χ2 distribution is k (df)
the variance of χ2 distribution is 2k

probability density function = ( 1/ 2^(k/2) Gamma(k/2) ) x^(k/2) e^(-x/2), x> 0 
                                0                                          x<=0
