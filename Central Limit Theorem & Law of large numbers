Central Limit Theorem (CLT)

The distirbution of a sample mean approximates a normal distribution as the sample size becomees larger. No matter what the shape of 
the population distribution.


Law of large numbers
An observed sample mean from a large sample will be close to the true population mean. And it will get closer when the sample size becomes larger.
