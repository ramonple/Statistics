When to use a Z score and When to use a T score?

General Rule of Thumb of When to Use a T score:
a. Unknown population std
b. sample size is below 30

When to use Z score?
a. knwo the population std
b. sample size is larger than 30



Z score: a conversion of individual scores into a standrd form 
         b. tells you how many std form the mean your result is
         c. u can use normal distributions to find what % of the population will fall below or above your result
       Z = (sample mean - population mean)/ ( population std/sqrt(n) )

T score: t = (sample mean - population mean)/ ( sample std/sqrt(n) )



Z-Tests and T-Tests

Z-tests are statistical calculations that can be used to compare population means to a sample's. 
The z-score tells you how far, in standard deviations, a data point is from the mean of the population. 
A z-test compares a sample to a defined population and is typically used for dealing with problems relating to large samples (n > 30). 
Z-tests can also be helpful when we want to test a hypothesis. Generally, they are most useful when the standard deviation is known.

t-tests are calculations used to test a hypothesis, but they are most useful when we need to determine if there is a statistically significant difference 
between two independent sample groups. 
In other words, a t-test asks whether a difference between the means of two groups is unlikely to have occurred because of random chance. 
Usually, t-tests are most appropriate when dealing with problems with a limited sample size (n < 30).

Both z-tests and t-tests require data with a normal distribution.
