-------------------------------------- Missing Values --------------------------------------
How to handle missing data?
a. delete rows with missing data
b. mean/ median/ mode imputation
c. assigning a unique value
d. predicting the missing values
e. using an algorithm which supports missing values, like random forests

The best method is to delete rows with missing data as it ensures no bias or variance is added or removed.
However, this is only recommended if there is enough data

-------------------------------------- Outliers --------------------------------------

How to detect outliers:
data visualization -> Boxplot, scatterplot, histogram
statistical way -> 
a. using the Z-scores
b. InterQuartile range (IQR) technique: IQR = Q3 - Q1 = third quartile - first quartile
Multiplying the interquartile range (IQR) by 1.5 will give us a way to determine whether a certain value is an outlier. 
If we subtract 1.5 x IQR from the first quartile, any data values that are less than this number are considered outliers. 
Similarly, if we add 1.5 x IQR to the third quartile, any data values that are greater than this number are considered outliers.

How to deal with the outliers?
1. remove the outliers
2. Quantile based flooring and capping: 
              The data points that are lesser than the 10th percentile are replaced with the 10th percentile value and 
              the data points that are greater than the 90th percentile are replaced with 90th percentile value.
3. Mean/ Median imputation:
          As the mean value is highly influenced by the outliers, it is advised to replace the outliers with the median value.
